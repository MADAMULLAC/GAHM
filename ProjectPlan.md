# GAHM
Game About Heuristic Mazes

## The Team
- Adam Worley
- Callum Harrod

### Aims
- Our aim is to create a fairly basic game built upon C++ and OpenGL.
- The end goal will be a game with not just basic gameplay mechanics such as movement and camera controls but also mechanics specific to our game.
- To build and run the game on the three major platforms.
- Include automated building or executable.

### Objectives
- Include more advanced shaders and shapes.
- Develop multiple levels (Possibly through level loading or procedurally generated).
- Generate executable/makefile.

## Project Pitch

We intend to make a time based game for the player to collect an array of cubes in the fastest time. The cubes will be spawned randomly on each execution of the game.

### Timeline and milestones

- week 6: By this time we plan on having a working engine, which allows us to render multiple cubes in the game world.
- week 8: By this time we are planning to have the random generation and textures for the game.
- week 10: By this time we are planning on having the automated build testing for the game..
- week 12: By this time we aim to have the finished product, which would include tweaking, asthetic changes, and building the final game.

### How to meet objectives

To meet our objectives we are planning on using the program trelo to set goals and make sure we achieve them. We are also going to constantly using git to manage the game from anywhere we are. Luckily we both live in the same house so we can constantly work on the game together to make sure it is to the best possible standard.

Using all the methods above should help us to completely finish our game to the best possible standards.

## Project Plan

##### Core Voxel Engine

- [ ] C++ base.
- [ ] openGL base.


## Proposed Technologies
We will be using C++, OpenGL, !..!; Building on all 3 major platforms (Windows, OSx, Linux) while developing on OSx.

## Marking Scheme

#### Basic percentage breakdown

30% For basic game that we had last semester with improvements.

20% For having a good makefile/exe.

20% Advanced texturing and game design.

15% For git usage.

10% For documentation.

5% Our panache.
